# Weekly Report 6

</div>

---

## Summary

This week was mainly devoted to final details, improving the code based on customer feedback and preparing the final presentation. The user manual was completed and revised on time. The late response from the customer caused us some problems with the first version, as we tried to correct the details with the time we had available. That's why we didn't have time to have a V2 of the code as we had previously planned.

## Conclusion

Despite some problems with response times with the customer and the team's lack of motivation at the start of the project, we did things that were relevant and fairly aligned with the requirements. The project improved day by day, with the team becoming more motivated thanks to the desire to succeed. The project ended on a positive note, with a more collaborative, efficient, communicative and united team.
